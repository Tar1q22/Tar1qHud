## A more modern take of the default hud

HUD aimed to be more modern-looking while keeping the aspect of TF2. Darhud was inspired by my concept design for a TF2 hud with a 50s/60s illustration style (think Fallout or jazz album covers), so now I'm using DarSitam's great work as a base to make something truer to my vision for my HUD.
